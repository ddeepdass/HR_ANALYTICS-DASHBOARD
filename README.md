This interactive HR Analytics Dashboard was built using Power BI to explore employee attrition patterns and key HR metrics across different segments of an organization. The purpose of this dashboard is to assist HR teams and decision-makers in identifying potential risk areas, improving retention strategies, and making data-driven decisions.

The dashboard provides a high-level summary with KPIs like total number of employees, attrition count, attrition rate, average age, average salary, and average years at the company. It also includes slicers for gender and department filters, making it easy to customize views and analyze trends specific to a segment.

To gain deeper insight into attrition, the dashboard breaks down data by multiple dimensions:

Attrition by Years: Displays yearly attrition count to understand long-term trends.

Attrition by Job Role: Highlights which job functions experience higher attrition rates.

Attrition by Income Level: Shows that employees in lower income brackets (especially those earning up to 5k) tend to leave more often.

Attrition by Age Group: Indicates younger employees, particularly those between 26â€“35, have higher attrition.

Attrition by Education and Field of Study: Includes both numerical breakdown and a donut chart to reveal which educational backgrounds (e.g., Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing) are more likely to leave.

The dashboardâ€™s intuitive design allows users to drill down into specific roles, age brackets, or education fields. It offers a clear visualization of trends and outliers that can be critical for building effective HR policies, improving employee engagement, and optimizing recruitment strategies.
